Image compression
it is the process of Reducing size of image.
Image compression works either by removing bytes  info. from image or by  using compression algo. to rewrite  the image file in a way that takes less space.
Importance:
image loads faster

lossy image compression
 it retains the most significant info for the image without keeping every single pixel.
Methods;
1.JPEG-Joint Photographic Experts Groups
widely used image comp. methd
2.WebP
3.HEIF highly efficiency image format also known as HEIC

lossless image comp.
reduces image size by as much as 40%
effective than lossy comp.
Methods:
Png-portable network graphics
gif graphics interchange format
bmp


common image compression algos
1.transform coding
lossy img comp.
uses tech. -discrete cosine transform
jpeg relies on it
2.RLE-run length encoding
lossless image comp.
encodes repeated pixels
3.Arithmetic Coding
lossless
encodes frequently used characters in an image file
4.Huffman coding
similar as arithmetic but does not reduce much size
5.LZW
Lempel ziv welch algo ,lossless image comp algo
6.Flate/deflate
